Agentic RAG for Cooking Recipes


## Usage

1. Install `uv` [(installation docs)](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/)
2. (Optional) If you want to use your own recipes instead of the default ones in the repo, [export your own cookbook in 'paprika recipe format'](https://paprikaapp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051324613-What-export-formats-do-you-support), and then replace the exported file in `resources/paprika/export.paprikarecipes`
3. Run `make` - this will install dependencies, build databases, and start the GUI application. See [advanced usage](#advanced-usage) for more information on each of the commands run by this abstraction and for control on GPU vs CPU device usage.

### Advanced Usage

Installing dependencies manually & choosing whether or not to use GPU/CPU:
```sh
make .venv # runs uv sync

# above command **should** automatically install torch w/ cuda or cpu for your system
# if you notice that it does not or you want to use cpu only, run following commands:
uv sync --extra cu128 # switch from torch CPU -> torch GPU (cuda >=12.8)
uv sync --extra cpu   # switch from torch GPU -> torch CPU
```

Building dependencies for the app (i.e. parsing resource files, creating vector db, etc.).
To have the app import your 

```sh
make .build
```

Run the app
```sh
# to automatically handle pre-requisite steps and start GUI 
make run # this is the same as running `make`
# or to only run the app
uv run -m src.cmd.start_app
```

Clean all files generated by the build:
```sh
make clean
```

During development, lint and fix linting errors with following commands:

```sh
make lint
make lint-fix
```
